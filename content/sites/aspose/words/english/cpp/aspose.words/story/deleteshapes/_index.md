// which has a parent Paragraph, which is a child node of the first section's Body.
builder->InsertShape(Aspose::Words::Drawing::ShapeType::Cube, 100.0, 100.0);

ASSERT_EQ(1, doc->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType::Shape, true)->get_Count());

// We can delete all shapes from the child paragraphs of this Body.
ASSERT_EQ(Aspose::Words::StoryType::MainText, doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->get_StoryType());
doc->get_FirstSection()->get_Body()->DeleteShapes();

ASSERT_EQ(0, doc->GetChildNodes(Aspose::Words::NodeType::Shape, true)->get_Count());
