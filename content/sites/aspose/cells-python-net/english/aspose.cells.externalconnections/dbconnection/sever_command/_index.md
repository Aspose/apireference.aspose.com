## sever_command property


Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based 
page fields are in use. 
For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no 
WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),
parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed

### Remarks 


NOTE: This property is now obsolete. Instead, 
please use ExternalConnection.SecondCommand property.
This method will be removed 12 months later since October 2024. 
Aspose apologizes for any inconvenience you may have experienced.
