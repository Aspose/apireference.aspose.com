In addition to standard IO (input-output) tools
the **Aspose.Svg.IO**  namespace contains helper classes and interfaces.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`FileCreateStreamProvider`](./aspose.svg.io/filecreatestreamprovider) | Represents FileStream implementation for providing streams to the rendering devices. |
| [`IBlob`](./aspose.svg.io/iblob) | A Blob object refers to a byte sequence, and has a size attribute which is the total number of bytes in the byte sequence, and a type attribute, which is an ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the byte sequence. |
| [`ICreateStreamProvider`](./aspose.svg.io/icreatestreamprovider) | Represents an interface that can be implemented by classes providing streams to the rendering devices. |
| [`IFile`](./aspose.svg.io/ifile) | A File object is a Blob object with a name attribute, which is a string; it can be created within the web application via a constructor, or is a reference to a byte sequence from a file from the underlying (OS) file system. |
| [`IFileList`](./aspose.svg.io/ifilelist) | Represent the interface for list of files. |
| [`IOutputStorage`](./aspose.svg.io/ioutputstorage) | Provides the creation and management of output streams [`OutputStream`](./aspose.svg.io/outputstream). |
| [`LocalFileSystemStorage`](./aspose.svg.io/localfilesystemstorage) | A file system storage. |
| [`OutputStream`](./aspose.svg.io/outputstream) | A surrogate stream wraps the real output stream and controls access to it.<br/>[`OutputStream`](./aspose.svg.io/outputstream) contains URI data that describes location of the output stream. |
| [`OutputStreamContext`](./aspose.svg.io/outputstreamcontext) | A context for initialization of the output stream. |
