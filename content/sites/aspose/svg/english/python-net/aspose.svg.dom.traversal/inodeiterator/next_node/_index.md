## next_node {#}

Returns the next node in the set and advances the position of the
iterator in the set. After a NodeIterator is created,
the first call to nextNode() returns the first node in
the set.


### Returns 


The next Node in the set being iterated over, or
null if there are no more members in that set.


```python
def next_node(self):
    ...
```
