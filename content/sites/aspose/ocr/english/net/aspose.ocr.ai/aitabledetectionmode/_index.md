## AITableDetectionMode enumeration

Defines the table detection modes used to improve table layout recognition.

```csharp
public enum AITableDetectionMode
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | `0` | Does not explicitly detect tables but processes the entire image as if it were a single table. Returns both the recognized text and any detected tables while improving the overall layout. Tables are detected but not cropped from the image. |
| AUTO | `1` | Automatically detects tables, extracts them from the surrounding text, applies proper table layout, and returns the fully structured and marked-up table. |
