## PreprocessingFilter class

Base class for image processing commands.

```csharp
public class PreprocessingFilter : IEnumerable
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PreprocessingFilter](preprocessingfilter)() | The default constructor. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Binarize](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/binarize)() | Converts an image to black-and-white image. Binary images are images whose pixels have only two possible intensity values. They are normally displayed as black and white. Numerically, the two values are often 0 for black, and 255 for white. Binary images are produced by auto thresholding an image. |
| static [ContrastCorrectionFilter](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/contrastcorrectionfilter)() | Contrast correction filter. |
| static [Dilate](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/dilate)() | Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image. |
| static [Invert](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/invert)() | Automatically inverts colors in a document image. |
| static [Median](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/median)() | The median filter run through each element of the image and replace each pixel with the median of its neighboring pixels. |
| static [Resize](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/resize)(int, int) | Rescale image - Upscale or downscale image resolution. InterpolationFilterType = Lanczos8 |
| static [Resize](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/resize)(int, int, InterpolationFilterType) | Rescale image - Upscale or downscale image resolution. |
| static [Rotate](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/rotate)(float) | Rotate original image. |
| static [Scale](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/scale)(float) | Rescale image - Upscale or downscale image resolution. InterpolationFilterType = Lanczos8 |
| static [Scale](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/scale)(float, InterpolationFilterType) | Rescale image - Upscale or downscale image resolution. |
| static [Threshold](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/threshold)(int) | Create a binary image based on setting a threshold value on the pixel intensity of the original image. |
| static [ToGrayscale](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/tograyscale)() | Converts an image to grayscale image. Grayscale image have 256 level of light in image (0 to 255). |
| [Add](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/add)(PreprocessingFilter) | Add the new filter to the collection to further run all operations. Consistency in the collection matters. |
| [GetEnumerator](../../aspose.ocr.models.preprocessingfilters/preprocessingfilter/getenumerator)() | For IEnumarable interface realization. |
