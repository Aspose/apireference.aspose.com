## DetectAreasMode enumeration

Determines the type of neural network used for areas detection.

```csharp
public enum DetectAreasMode
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LEAN | `0` | Prioritizes speed and reduces resource consumption by omitting support for complex layouts. Suitable only for simple images with a few lines of text without illustrations or formatting. |
| MULTICOLUMN | `1` | Detects large blocks of text formatted in columns. The best choice for multi-column layouts such as book pages, articles, or contracts. |
| UNIVERSAL | `2` | Detects all blocks of text in the image, including sparse and irregular text on photos. A versatile option for most images, except for tables and multi-column layouts. |
| TABLE | `4` | Detects tabular structures in the image and extracts text from individual cells. Recommended for scanned spreadsheets, reports, and other table-based documents. |
| CURVED_TEXT | `5` | Automatically straightens curved lines of text in the image, improving recognition accuracy and allowing more text to be recovered and extracted. Requires significant processing power and RAM. |
| FORMULA | `6` | Detects all blocks with mathematical formulas. |

### Remarks

Used in the [`RecognitionSettings`](../recognitionsettings) to specify which type of image you want to recognize.
