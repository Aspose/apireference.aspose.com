## RecognitionSettings constructor

Initializes a new instance of the [`RecognitionSettings`](../../recognitionsettings) class with full set of properties.

```csharp
public RecognitionSettings(Language language = Language.None, 
    List<Rectangle> recognitionAreas = null, bool detectAreas = true, bool autoSkew = true, 
    float skewAngle = 0, bool recognizeSingleLine = false, int threshold = 0)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| language | Language | Language used for OCR. |
| recognitionAreas | List`1 | Manually set areas for recognition. Null by default - means whole image is processed. |

| autoSkew | Boolean | Enable automatic image skew correction. |
| skewAngle | Single | Set angle for image rotation. |
| recognizeSingleLine | Boolean | For single-line images |
