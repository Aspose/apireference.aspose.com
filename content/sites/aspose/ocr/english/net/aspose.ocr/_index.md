| [Character](./character) | Data about detected character. |
| [CharacterRecognitionResult](./characterrecognitionresult) | Pages with detected characters data. |
| [ContentArea](./contentarea) | A content area detected in an image. |
| [DefectAreas](./defectareas) | Image areas containing a certain type of defect. |
| [DefectOutput](./defectoutput) | Areas containing defects identified in the image. |
| [IDCardRecognitionSettings](./idcardrecognitionsettings) | Settings for the ID Card recognition. Contains elements that allow customizing the recognition process. |
| [ImageData](./imagedata) | Information about processed / recognized image. |
| [ImageProcessing](./imageprocessing) | Helper class for Aspose OCR library. Allows to preprocess and save images. |
| [InvoiceRecognitionSettings](./invoicerecognitionsettings) | Settings for the invoice recognition. Contains elements that allow customizing the recognition process. |

| [LayoutOutput](./layoutoutput) | Information on detected content areas in the image. |
| [License](./license) | Provides methods to license the component. |
| [Logging](./logging) | Class to create log configurations. |
| [Metered](./metered) | Provides methods to set metered key. |
| [OcrInput](./ocrinput) | Container to collect all images / documents for preprocessing / recognition. |
| [OcrOutput](./ocroutput) | A container class to store and manage the results of OCR operations. |
| [OcrRecognizeEventHandler](./ocrrecognizeeventhandler) | A delegate to track the progress of multi-page image recognition. |
| [OCRTable](./ocrtable) | Represents one table with recognized tabular data. |
| [OCRTableCell](./ocrtablecell) | Represents one table cell with recognized text and position information. |
| [OCRTablePage](./ocrtablepage) | Represents structured table data for the entire OCR document's page. |
| [OCRTableRow](./ocrtablerow) | Represents a single row within a recognized table. |
| [OnnxRuntimeSessionOptions](./onnxruntimesessionoptions) | Configuration options for creating ONNX InferenceSession. We recommend keeping the optimized defaults unless you are absolutely certain about the modifications. For technical details, refer to ONNX Runtime documentation. |
| [PassportRecognitionSettings](./passportrecognitionsettings) | Settings for the passport recognition. Contains elements that allow customizing the recognition process. |
| [ReceiptRecognitionSettings](./receiptrecognitionsettings) | Settings for the receipt recognition. Contains elements that allow customizing the recognition process. |
| [RecognitionResult](./recognitionresult) | The results of the image recognition. Contains elements with recognition information and methods for result export. |
