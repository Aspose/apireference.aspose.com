## Methods


### CURVED_TEXT {#CURVED-TEXT}
```
public static final DetectAreasMode CURVED_TEXT
```


Automatically straightens curved lines of text in the image, improving recognition accuracy and allowing more text to be recovered and extracted. Requires significant processing power and RAM.

### LEAN {#LEAN}
```
public static final DetectAreasMode LEAN
```


Prioritizes speed and reduces resource consumption by omitting support for complex layouts. Suitable only for simple images with a few lines of text without illustrations or formatting.

### MULTICOLUMN {#MULTICOLUMN}
```
public static final DetectAreasMode MULTICOLUMN
```


Detects large blocks of text formatted in columns. Best choice for multi-column layouts such as book pages, articles, or contracts.

### TABLE {#TABLE}
```
public static final DetectAreasMode TABLE
```


Detects tabular structures in the image and extracts text from individual cells. Recommended for scanned spreadsheets, reports, and other table-based documents.

### UNIVERSAL {#UNIVERSAL}
```
public static final DetectAreasMode UNIVERSAL
```


Detects all blocks of text in the image, including sparse and irregular text on photos. A versatile option for most images, except for tables and multi-column layouts.
